<!-- Recently Active User -->
<!-- GOAL: Identify recently active users by using attributes/classes in the HTML. Output the tested selector in the log. -->
<!-- CURRENT STATE: Our app is not correctly identifying recently active users, some profiles to be liked when they shouldn't -->
<!-- REMARKS: Certain classNames or attributes may be obfuscated (and look like random strings, avoid these
     and rely on HTML structure or human readable names, you are allowed to use partial matching.) 
     -->
<!-- SUGGESTION TO CLAUDE: Try to use the background-badge-online-now-default class as an identifier -->
