The current implementation of the behaviour profiles are robotic. 
The goal is for the behaviour profiles to be more human-like, and less likely to be detected as bots.
But if our application never changes the way it behaves, it will appear robotic.

The behaviour profiles should be more dynamic, and change over time (thinking delays, number of photos to view, etc.).
This might mean creating new ones on the fly, or changing existing ones.
Work with me to come up with a solution here.
